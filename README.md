## Uso
Once the project is downloaded, open it with the Unity application.
Once opened we can see inside Assets/Scenes the different scenes that we have used and with a double click we can load it and then press play to see it in action.

You can also use the executable to see how the environment is and how the agent uses the latest version of our trained network.
